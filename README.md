## Why i want to contribute to open source

#To be able to improve my code daily as earlier i had to make different files altogether and copy paste code and then make changes in #the duplicate file which was very tedious

#To be able to share my code with my friends and do group projects
#will help me to practice CS lab questions before exam with my mentors
#To be involved in developing the amazing amount of free software open Source developers develop such as krita, OBS Studio, Blender etc.
